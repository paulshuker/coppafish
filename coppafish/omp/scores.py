    """
    Computes OMP score(s) for the coefficient image. This is a weighted average of spot_shape_mean at spot_shape's == 1
    in a local area with their corresponding coefficients. This is a convolution over the entire image. Scores can
    range anywhere from 0 to infinity.

    Args:
        - coefficient_image (`(n_batches x im_y x im_x x im_z) tensor[float32]`): OMP coefficients in 3D shape. Any
            non-computed or out of bounds coefficients will be zero.
        - spot (`(size_y x size_x x size_z) tensor[int]`): OMP spot shape. It is a made up of only zeros and ones.
            Ones indicate where the spot coefficient is likely to be positive.
        - mean_spot (`(size_y x size_x x size_z) tensor[float32]`): OMP mean spot shape. This can range from -1 and 1.
        - force_cpu (bool): use the CPU only, never the GPU. Default: true.

    Returns:
        (`(n_batches x im_y x im_x x im_z) tensor[float32]`) score_image: OMP score for every coefficient image pixel,
            on every given batch.
